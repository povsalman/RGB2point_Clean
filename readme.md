**RGB2Point** is officially accepted to WACV 2025. It takes a single unposed RGB image to generate 3D Point Cloud. Check more details from the [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.14979).
## Codes
**RGB2Point** is tested on Ubuntu 22 and Windows 11. `Python 3.9+` and `Pytorch 2.0+` is required.

## Dependencies
Assuming `Pytorch 2.0+` with `CUDA` is installed, run:
```
pip install timm
pip install accelerate
pip install wandb
pip install open3d
pip install scikit-learn
```

## Training
```
python train.py
```
